# Pick Key Game

## The Project

This project was developed with the aim of working on both front-end and back-end. A registration and login system was created to access a typing game.

## Technologies

HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP were the technologies used.

## The Game

The game involves typing, using a virtual keyboard, the word displayed on the screen. However, with each key press, the positions of the keys are randomly shuffled, thereby engaging the user's selective attention.
